# `@docker/docker-mui-theme`

This package provides a Material UI theme that specifies the basic look & feel of Docker Desktop in an application-agnostic way. This is the only officially supported theming solution for Docker Extensions.

## How to use

Wrap your React application with one of the two theme providers (see _MUI Versions_ section below), and then render a MUI `CssBaseline` component somewhere within it.

For best results integrating with Docker Desktop, also read our [MUI best practices](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/design/mui-best-practices/) article.

```jsx
import { DockerMuiV6ThemeProvider } from '@docker/docker-mui-theme';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';

function App() {
  return (
    <DockerMuiV6ThemeProvider>
      <CssBaseline />

      <YourAppContent />
    </DockerMuiV6ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## MUI Versions

Docker Desktop currently primarily supports MUI v6, but has legacy support for MUI v5. When wrapping your app, use the appropriate context provider:

- `DockerMuiV6ThemeProvider` for MUI v6
- `DockerMuiV5ThemeProvider` for MUI v5

A future major version change will remove support for MUI v5.
